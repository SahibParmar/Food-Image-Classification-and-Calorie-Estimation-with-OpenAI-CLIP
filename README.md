# Food Image Classification and Calorie Estimation

This project leverages the **CLIP(Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining)** architecture to recognize food items from images. A fully connected classifier is trained on top of CLIP to predict food categories.The model provides rough estimates (high, medium, low) based on food type.
The training data used here is food101 dataset.

The prodigy_ml_05(Using_CLIP).ipynb contains the actual training code and CLIP_model_weights.pth contains weight of the trained model.

Following are few demonstration examples
